#### Warning! This is an amusement school project. I don't own the jokes or the gifs displayed (not even the background image). 
#### Problem:
When I started to search for APIs to integrate in this project I had a bad day and I found the random joke API. I found the jokes funny and worth of sharing so I started thinking of a project that does random entertainment stuff. After a small research I found out that GIPHY has APIs and a specific random GIF API. When I need something dumb to amuse me, I enter on this AWS hosted website and I stay like 3 minutes rerolling jokes and GIFs. Have fun!

#### APIs
#### Random joke API` ` - it is at free of use and it is provided by official-joke-api.appspot.com. They have 3 GET APIs "Try /random_joke, /random_ten, /jokes/random, or /jokes/ten" . I used the /random_joke. It does not require input parameters or query parameters.
